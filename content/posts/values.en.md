## My values
Values are abstract concepts, and sometimes they are perceived as buzzwords. But values are important to me and I try to embed them in my actions.

These are my values:

- Autonomy
- Awareness
- Continuous improvement
- Creativity
- Education
- Joy
- Openness
- Privacy
- Simplicity > Complexity
- Sustainability
- Work-life balance
