    I gained early professional experience as a Unix administrator and a brief stint as a minimal techno DJ. I earned a degree in Sociology from the University of Constance and worked in sales for outdoor and mountaineering brands, eventually managing a specialty retail store. From 2014 to 2023, I ran a successful communication agency offering content creation, editorial services, and strategic communication consulting. As an entrepreneur, I led projects across industries, focusing on tailored messaging, client collaboration, and adaptability. Between 2021 and 2024, I worked as a social worker supporting young people and refugees in integrating into German society. Since 2024, I’ve been a public relations specialist at a district office, focusing on social issues and community communication. Outside of work, I run blogs, design and sew ultralight hiking gear, and enjoy life and long-distance hikes in the Alps.  image:

  title: "Experience"
  description: >
   Experienced Sociologist with a Focus on Ethnography. With a deep understanding of sociological theories and ethnographic methods, I have conducted field work and research, shedding light on social structures, power dynamics, and community interactions. My work is characterized by a critical approach that seeks to challenge prevailing structures and explore alternative possibilities. I have gained experience in both academic and practical settings, enabling me to effectively bridge theory and practice. My primary focus lies in studying grassroots movements, community organizations, and forms of collective action, where I develop innovative approaches to understand social realities from diverse perspectives. This experience has equipped me with the skills to analyze and document complex social processes while collaborating closely with various communities to amplify their voices and experiences.

      content: "Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
